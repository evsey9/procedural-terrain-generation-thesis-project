A procedural terrain generation system made in Godot 4.4.1 utilizing C#, the Godot Voxel library, and a whole bunch of Simplex noise. Read the research paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_wSYdPg5frtCfvzs-9a0Q7d0ijuYOaT/view?usp=sharing), or look through the short presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sc9wjf9q-ml3SehKVfXQ465ush4YA8fh/view?usp=sharing) to get a quick understanding of how the algorithm works.

# Building

Download the project, compile with Godot 4.4.1 that was compiled with Godot Voxel.
